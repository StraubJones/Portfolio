# J. Christian Straubhaar-Jones' Web Development Portfolio

A personal portfolio website, with details concerning my various web development projects.

## New Tool Explorations in This Project
As this site states, I like to explore new tools! The ones that I explored for the first time here are:
- React Router
- [React Scroll](https://github.com/fisshy/react-scroll) (an open source project)
- LESS

## Personal Backlog
Some things I'd like to get working better.
- Mobile footer oddness.
- D3 chart for skills.

## Getting Started

```
$ yarn
$ yarn setup
$ yarn start
```

Now visit [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000/)

### Running the Tests

There is a basic test framework in your `test/` folder. Here's how to use it:

```bash
$ yarn test                 # runs all tests
$ yarn test server/index.js # runs tests in a single file
```

## Made with Concatapult

See [the `pult` docs](https://github.com/Concatapult/pult#readme) for adding additional modules to this boilerplate.
